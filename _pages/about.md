Hi, my name is Manish. I love to think and read about how human intelligence has arisen and whether human level general intelligence can be replicated on machines. This motivates me to study machine learning. I code on Python to solve and optimize human problem using robotics process automation, machine learning, deep learning or combination of all.

I also like to work on backend applications, Experimenting with different frameworks to test and deploy APIâ€™s. I have about 3 years of experience in working different startups in sectors like healthcare, finance and process automation.

When I'm not in front of a whiteboard or computer, I'm probably playing football, reading about psychology, taking entrepreneur courses or binge watching some movies

I hope my blog can light up some eager minds who share the same passion as I do. If you want to collaborate on projects, feel free to reach out to me.
