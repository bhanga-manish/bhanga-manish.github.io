excerpt: "A blog where I express my feelings to you, hopefully in a better way"

Hello, I have so much to say but as soon as I begin putting it in words my brain keep showing me that Jethalal sticker. Since I am still looking for a comeback for that, I took a pause, drank a cup of coffee in my fav mug, reminiscing the time we click this beautiful picture and I keep imagining that you are sitting beside me and that has given me good hopes that I will pour out my words in a better way.

I feel I have a mind to mind connection with you. It has been getting stronger and richer with each day passing. It feels like we are two different systems learning a new language, making adjustments, corrections to what we individually know and have learnt. It feels amazing to see how our conversations have gone deep, have become richer in emotions and how there are so less emotional barriers to access each other's feelings and I respect the changes you have made willingly and I am sorry that you have to make some unwillingly out of my conditions and some external factors, Nevertheless I am happy to see how far you have come.

Sometimes in a moment the connection stops sending the messages which it usually sends, instead it replies with the msg saying "The heart you're trying to reach is unreachable". Sometimes it feels like getting blank static signal like we used to get in televisions.

As person who has been intrigued by the complex systems and problems, I tend to analyze and understand why does this connection has been affected. And many times I can't find a reason for it, hence I asked you what goes in your mind when you are silent and I felt calm when you said you are thoughtless for 70-80% of time. For the 30-20% of time it feels like you go crawl up in your heart or wrap a safety boundary around your head in a way that nothing leaves your mind.

I don't mind you spending time with your thoughts, with your inner self, solving mysteries, carving the beautiful world with your zeal or just figuring some more ways to tease me. But Sometimes I feel you go into parallel world of "What If's" or "Concerns" or "Contemplation".

<img src="{{ site.url }}{{ site.baseurl }}/images/Anishaa/" alt="Parallel world">

I don't know exactly how do you feel when you are in that world or zone. But I have seen how difficult it is for you to speak your mind, to just say a word, to let me know that you are bothered. That 2 mins you took to speak up but failed while I said what I would have asked if I would have won the game. For those 2 mins I just wanted to hug you tight enough to enter that safety boundary and listen to your thoughts and tame them down and bring you back with me. But you brought yourself back in a minute changed your mood stood so strong that you didn't let your thoughts over power you and I am proud you for that <3.

It feels like the more time you spend in that zone or world the questions and scenarios keeps branching out to adverse & diverse possible events which may occur in future, which in turns scares you about the path we are walking on. The more you traverse these branches it makes me feels that you are moving more farther away from me than ever. With that the connection gets weaker and weaker and the response I get is "The heart you're trying to reach is unreachable". I can feel you talking to me, sitting next to me but with that invisible mask around your head which prohibits from me to enter in your mind and prohibits you to speak your mind.

I could be wrong and I wish to be wrong here. I want to understand you, how you handle yourself, how you treat your thoughts which pulls you away from reality. How do you help yourself stay calm in the moments when fear keeps lingering in the mind and I want to be part of it (I know it's too soon for it and I am not pushing just expressing) to ease that process for you, to bring you back in the reality with confidence that all those branches you have been traversing will never come to reality.

When I am the reason for you to go in that zone, it breaks my heart a bit because I feel I let you down by pushing you in that world where I want nobody to be in. This is not the life I want you to spend with me. May be my traits, attributes or attributes makes you worry about the path we are on.

At this point it's 3:29 AM and we just hung up the call and I am getting the same message from the connection and I don't know what has made you upset, in what world you are and for what. I can see you trying so hard to talk to me normally, I don't know if you listened to all my stories with excitement, I don't know whether you'll remember them to tease sometime in near future. I trust you with all my heart and have accepted you as the person with whom I have started my journey of life. But exploring this unknown of yours feels little lonely. I am very appreciative of you putting up with me despite going through something.

By the time you'll be reading this we would have done SPA together, seen midnight in paris, had good dinner and now soaking the views on Marines, hopefully that would have cheered you up.

Now resuming back to topic.
I don't know which part of me makes you go through this, whether it's my habit, or do I say something which I shouldn't have, but whatever it is, I want to assure you that I'll be changing, may be changing is wrong word. Let me try to explain in much deeper way.

How I am right now is because I have lived my life in certain way for 27 years and I know I have picked up some wrong traits which I shouldn't have but it was the environment which made me pick it up. I didn't have any guidance or someone to take my hand to stop me doing it. But now I have you and I can see where I have been wrong in my life and with that, with you I am picking that up, with conscious decision and I am training my unconscious mind to be naturally be good at it.

Why I am saying this is because, I don't want to feel alone with you. You are the backbone I was missing, since life started pushing me in corner and beating me up. So far I have dealt with everything life has thrown at me with chin up. For once in my life I have felt that I have shoulder to rely on to not fight battles within and outside alone. You do feel reachable to me, a text, a call away. But I don't know yet you still feel far away.
I know you care for me a lot, you won't let me down, and will pick me up every time you see me falling. But I want you to support me even when I am standing.

I am not low at this point don't worry. I am worried about you, I can't see you not excited for something that you were so excited for till yesterday. I want to bring you back from that world, if I could I'll create a portal reach to you. Pick you up in my arms and place you here in marines and hoping to see a my Happy Anu back.

This connection which I keep talking about is a voice inside my head, like a assistant which does analytics for me, makes my senses sharp, helps me focus and makes me alert of any danger in my surrounding. Whenever you go aise silent ya behavior change it feels like there is something stuck in my teeth and my tongue is going again and again at that teeth but when I reach out with my hand I couldn't find anything and it get's annoying and same feeling I get when I ask you what is wrong and I couldn't know what's wrong.

I know it's difficult for you to trust me again and let me in, when I have broken yours couple of times in bin bin prakaar. I am sorry for it, just saying sorry doesn't wash away the doubts of it. Here's what I am gonna do, At this point if everything happens by the plan you'd be reading this on Marines, I want you to look at me and open you hand.

Don't get shocked these are two promise rings I have bought one for you and one for me. I am going to wear mine with the promise that I'LL NEVER GET ANGRY ON YOU. I promise that, the ring is reminder of it and it'll be on me forever. Even if I do get angry on you for some reason. I'll gently take my ring off place it on your palm like this and let you know that I am angry and ask you to manao me as soon as I am good. I'll wear it again and never take it off.

The other ring is for you, I want you to wear whenever you feel you can be transparent with me, the day I see this ring in your finger I'll feel that I don't have rely on my senses (connection) to know how you are because I believe you'll tell me everything you feel. And then I will no longer let my tongue annoy me.

PS: I have written this in parts and during half asleep state, if my narrative missed the bigger picture, this is what I want to convey:- You don't have to worry of anything bad happening and if there's something bothering you I am there with you. I don't want you to lose interest, excitement in life. If it's something related to me I'll change it at the very moment and I promise to never get angry on you. As promised here is the ring.

PPS: I Love You.
