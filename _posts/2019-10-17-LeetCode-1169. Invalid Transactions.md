### Problem statement :-
A transaction is possibly invalid if:

the amount exceeds $1000, or;
if it occurs within (and including) 60 minutes of another transaction with the same name in a different city.
Each transaction string transactions[i] consists of comma separated values representing the name, time (in minutes), amount, and city of the transaction.

Given a list of transactions, return a list of transactions that are possibly invalid.  You may return the answer in any order.

### Example
> Input: transactions = ["alice,20,800,mtv","alice,50,100,beijing"]
>  Output: ["alice,20,800,mtv","alice,50,100,beijing"]
> Input: transactions = ["alice,20,800,mtv","alice,50,1200,mtv"]
> Output: ["alice,50,1200,mtv"]
> Input: transactions = ["alice,20,800,mtv","bob,50,1200,mtv"]
> Output: ["bob,50,1200,mtv"]
