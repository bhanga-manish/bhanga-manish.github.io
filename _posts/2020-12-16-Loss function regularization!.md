2020 has been a year of blue...
And I met you out the blue...
Now comes Christmas Day when I disappointed you...
I don't know what I can do....

Accepting my mistake and learning from it is what I'll do..
Frequently I'll say sorry too...
May be this will make better too...
Hopefully that will bring out Bhanga Version 2...

Expressing in words is where I fail...
I swear I'll not repeat this trail...
I'll keep eye on every tale I tell...
Please accept this apology without fail :see_no_evil:
